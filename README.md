# Prosper Loan Exploratory Data Analysis - Udacity Project

## By Julien Beaulieu


Introdcution
============

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. This document explores a dataset containing information about <a href='https://www.prosper.com/'>Prosper</a>'s loan data. Prosper is America’s first
marketplace lending platform, with over $9 billion in funded loans.
This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. We're specifically interested in learning about which kinds of loans yield the highest returns, and which loans have the lowest Annual Percentage Rate (APR). We'll be looking at the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations. 

When you take out a loan, your interest rate represents the interest percentage you will be charged for borrowing the money, but does not include origination fees, closing fees, documentation fees, and other finance charges. 
We're looking at APR over interest rates because APR gives you a more comprehensive look at how much you’ll pay when you borrow money for a loan by factoring in these additional fees. When it comes to APR vs. interest rate, the former more accurately represents the true cost of the loan.

The outline of this project is:

-   Introduction
-   Univariate Data Analysis
-   Bivariate Data Analysis
-   Multivariate Data Analysis
-   Summary and Conclusion


Univariate Data Analysis
========================

We'll start by looking at our two variables of interest: The distribution of Borrower APR and Estimated Return. 
We'll then proceed in looking at the distribution of other quantitative variables.
